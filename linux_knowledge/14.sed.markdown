The `sed` command is used for batch modification of text content. When processing, `sed` reads a line, stores the currently processed line in a temporary buffer, and after processing the content in the buffer, it prints it to the screen. Then it reads the next line and performs the next loop. This process repeats continuously until the end of the file.

```shell
sed [options] 'command' file
```

Since running without the `-i` option will only output to the console and not write to the file, `-i` is added by default.

## Insertion
`1a` Inserts after the 1st line
`1i` Inserts before the 1st line

```shell
sed -i '' '1a\
insert after' 1.txt
```

## Deletion

Deletes lines that match a specific pattern or deletes lines within a specified line number range
```shell
sed -i '.txt' '1,2d' 3.txt
```

```shell
sed '/error/d' file.txt
```

## Append

```shell
sed -i '/test/a\'
```

## Replacement

```shell
s/search_pattern/replacement_text/flags
```
Flags can be:
- `g`: Global replacement, not only replacing the first match in each line
- `i`: Case-insensitive matching

```shell
sed -i '.txt' 's/A/666/g' 3.txt
```

## Automatic Backup File Creation

```shell
sed -i.bak 's/coding3min/kitty/g' config.txt
```

## Combined with grep

```shell
sed -i 's/coding/kitty/g' `grep -rl coding *`
```
