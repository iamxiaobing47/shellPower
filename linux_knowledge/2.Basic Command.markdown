# Basic Command

## `which`

Linux commands are essentially binary executable programs, and the `which` command is used to find the path of system executables.

```bash
which command_name
```

1. Find the executable file path of the `ls` command:
   ```bash
   which ls
   ```

2. If `which` finds the command, it will output the full path of that command; if not found, it will output an error message.

## `wc`

The `wc` command is used to count the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file.

```bash
wc [options] [file...]
```

- `-l`: Count only the number of lines.
- `-w`: Count only the number of words.
- `-c`: Count only the number of bytes.

1. Count the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file:
   ```bash
   wc file.txt
   ```

2. Count only the number of lines:
   ```bash
   wc -l file.txt
   ```

3. Count only the number of words:
   ```bash
   wc -w file.txt
   ```

## Pipe Symbol `|`

1. Use `grep` to search for text in a file and use `wc` to count the matching lines:
   ```bash
   grep "pattern" file.txt | wc -l
   ```

2. Combine multiple commands to perform complex tasks, for example, search for text in a file, count the matching lines, and then filter out certain lines:
   ```bash
   grep "pattern" file.txt | wc -l | grep -v "0"
   ```

## `vim`

`/` Enters search mode
