# Directory Stack

Bash provides a directory stack feature.

## cd -

By default, Bash only remembers the last directory, and the `cd -` command can return to the last directory.

```bash
$ cd -
```

## pushd, popd

If you want to remember multiple directories, you can use the `pushd` command and `popd` command. They are used to manipulate the directory stack.

The `popd` command, when used without parameters, will remove the top record of the stack and enter the new top directory of the stack

## dirs Command

The `dirs` command can display the contents of the directory stack, usually used to view the results after `pushd` and `popd` operations.

```bash
$ dirs
```
